# Example data set: Combined TMS Motor Study — Mixed Online/Offline Stimulation

This data set provides an example of formatting using a proposed nibs-bidsv5+ standard.

## Experiment details
This example demonstrates a realistic multi-session experiment combining both offline and online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols targeting the motor cortex and parietal regions.

Session 1 (Offline): Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) applied to the parietal cortex (600 pulses, no concurrent recording).

Session 2 (Online): Mixed TMS protocols including Single Pulse, Short-Interval Intracortical Inhibition (SICI), Intracortical Facilitation (ICF), and Silent Period (SP) — applied during EMG/EEG recording over the motor cortex.

Session 3 (Online): Repetition of session 2 to assess test–retest reliability.
